<p>The techniques of commercial design promote given content to be presented or designed. Layers of meaning as well as associations within content is visually presented through the designer’s hands. However, this sort of design actually just relies upon the nature of the content, the underlying meaning. The designer, in essence, captures these moments and presents them as visual form; hence, the designer as a curator. <br><br>

Taking a step away from the designer’s urge to stylize or aestheticize, a pureness of the content and the natural links provides enough design to present meaning. perhaps anything deeper than control comes from chance.

An understanding of found collage or found collection as a form of design. Design less curated but formed naturally.

-   Chance produced material<br><br>

-   Google image search and the related content on the web<br>

This publishing project is divided into three parts, three different versions: the Top Ten Most Wanted, the first ten on the list of Violent Criminal Apprehension Program Unidentified Persons, and the Top Ten Art Theft Crimes. The three different versions explore different missing content that people are still searching for. The process of continuous Google Search and the collected images created a story, a search for the missing object or person. The linked images become a new context for the image curated by the act of searching and the existing system embedded within Google. 
<br><br>
The act of publishing has been executed in different ways including, photo book, website with downloadable zip files with the original image files, videos showing the gradual steps from the final image towards the missing object. The library of linked images located on the website is accessible to anyone on the internet, whereas the book form is the physical, printed representation of the collections. The videos exist to highlight the visual transformations in a more impactful fashion. These various acts of publishing act as one whole project presented in different ways.
